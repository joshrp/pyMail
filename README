Main Objective:
A simple email stack that can be configured simply and intuitivly and deployed
quickly with the most common feature set:
    SMTP(AUTH, Signing)
    IMAP(Fast, Customizable for proprietry client, cached)
    POP(.....simple)
    Virtual Domains (single domain instances know no difference)

Current State pre-alpha:

pyMail can receive local mail and relay mail 
it resolves and retrives the highest preference mail server for remotes
and delivers with its client. Features are basic as this is pre pre pre(^100) 
alpha stage and getting SMTP sending and receiving working was the priority.

It stores local mail in MongoDB using the db_format method. The only 
required fields at this stage are domains->name & alias.

pyMail expects to be able to import:
    pyMongo (and therefore mongoDB obv.)
    dns (dnspython.org for resolving MX records for domains
    
whether these are in the directory or in PYTHONPATH is irrelevent 

better configurations for db's are in the works
