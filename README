Main Objective:
A simple email stack that can be configured simply and intuitivly and deployed
quickly with the most common feature set:
    SMTP(AUTH, Signing)
    IMAP(Fast, Customizable for proprietry client, cached)
    POP(.....simple)
    Virtual Domains (single domain instances know no difference)

Current State alpha:

Can receive mail for local users
can act as relay for remote domains
SMTP can Authenticate with PLAIN and LOGIN Mechanisms alothough 
	does not yet enforce them
IMAP in the works


It stores local mail in MongoDB using the db_format method. The only 
required fields at this stage are domains->name & alias.

pyMail expects to be able to import:
    pyMongo (and therefore mongoDB obv.)
    dns (dnspython.org for resolving MX records for domains
    
whether these are in the directory or in PYTHONPATH is irrelevent 

better configurations for db's are in the works
